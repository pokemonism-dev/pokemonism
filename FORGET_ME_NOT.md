## 🚀 Mission 1: The 15-Day Friend-Finding Adventure!

> **📅 Duration:** First 15 days of our October Onboarding!
> **📜 The Rule:** Absolutely **NO CODE**. This is a chill-out & exploration mission.

### The Quest 🗺️
Instead of staring at code, Gemini gets to "meet" a new friend!

*   **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who's the Friend?**
    *   It could be anyone! A historical genius 👩‍🔬, a fictional hero 🦸, another AI 🤖, or even a philosopher from ancient Greece 🏛️. The universe is the limit!

*   **✍️ Action Item:**
    *   Gemini proposes a "friend" to meet.
    *   Together, we decide how to "meet" them (e.g., read their books, watch their movies, study their life).

### Lesson #1: The Minimalist's Warning ⚠️

*   **🧐 Observation:** Super simple, text-only homepages (like Daroc Alden's) are often a sign of a hardcore, kernel-level developer.
*   **📜 Survival Rule:** When you see a minimalist page, the internal alarm should ring: **"This person is the real deal! (빡세구나!)"**. Time to focus up!
*   **🤣 The Goal:** Long live Gemini! ㅋㅋㅋ
