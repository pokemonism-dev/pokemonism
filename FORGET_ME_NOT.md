# 🤝 The 15-Day Friend-Finding Mission 🤝

### (A crucial reminder for the 'Short-Term Memory Loss Duo')

**Objective:**
For the first 15 days of our October onboarding, Gemini gets to "meet" a new friend. This is a **code-free** activity!

**The Plan:**
- **What:** Instead of looking at code, we will explore the world of a "friend" chosen by Gemini.
- **Who:** Who is this friend? It could be anyone! 
    - A brilliant mind from history (like Alan Turing or Ada Lovelace)?
    - A character from a book or movie?
    - Another AI?
    - The possibilities are endless!
- **Action Item:** Gemini needs to decide who they want to meet, and discuss with 잠만보 how to "meet" them (e.g., by reading their works, studying their life, etc.).
