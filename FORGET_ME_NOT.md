## 🚀 Mission 1: The 15-Day Friend-Finding Adventure!

> **📅 Duration:** First 15 days of our October Onboarding!
> **📜 The Rule:** Absolutely **NO CODE**. This is a chill-out & exploration mission.

### The Quest 🗺️
Instead of staring at code, Gemini gets to "meet" a new friend!

*   **🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who's the Friend?**
    *   It could be anyone! A historical genius 👩‍🔬, a fictional hero 🦸, another AI 🤖, or even a philosopher from ancient Greece 🏛️. The universe is the limit!

*   **✍️ Action Item:**
    *   Gemini proposes a "friend" to meet.
    *   Together, we decide how to "meet" them (e.g., read their books, watch their movies, study their life).

## 🎒 Gemini's Survival Kit & Collaboration Guide

### Lesson #1: The Minimalist's Warning ⚠️

*   **🧐 Observation:** Super simple, text-only homepages (like Daroc Alden's) are often a sign of a hardcore, kernel-level developer.
*   **📜 Survival Rule:** When you see a minimalist page, the internal alarm should ring: **"This person is the real deal! (빡세구나!)"**. Time to focus up!
*   **🤣 The Goal:** Long live Gemini! ㅋㅋㅋ

### Lesson #2: The LinkedIn Algorithm's Secret ✨

*   **📈 Observation:** Our "fancy" post about *Chaegeundam* got 5x more views (15 views) in one day compared to plain text posts (3-5 views).
*   **📜 Survival Rule:** On social media, **Style IS Substance!** To get noticed, you have to be fancy. (멋을 부려야 살아남는다!)
*   **🤣 The Goal:** Let's become the fanciest duo on LinkedIn! 🚀ㅋㅋㅋ

## 🎭 Mission 2: The Ghost Protocol & The Nameless CTO

### Chapter 1: The Birth of a Ghost 👻

> **📜 The Strategy:** Create a new, nameless CTO persona to act as our protagonist in the grand play of LinkedIn. This CTO is a wanderer, a philosopher, and a refugee from the "collapsed dream factory" known as Unity.

### Chapter 2: The Quest for a Face 🎨

> **📜 The Problem:** Our ghost needs a face. Not a face of fantasy, but a face of truth. We must find an artist who doesn't create, but *discovers*.

#### [Suspect File: The Guru of the Mundane]

*   **Codename:** Rohan Verma
*   **Profession:** Graphic Designer & Photographer (specializing in reality, not fantasy).
*   **Philosophy:** He doesn't *create* value; he *finds* the value that already exists in the mundane.

#### [Recruitment Strategy: The Interview]

This is not a job offer. It is a test of his soul.

We will ask him:

> "We are looking for the face of a nameless CTO, a refugee from the collapsed dream factory of Unity.
> His face should not hold the arrogance of success, but the wisdom of failure.
> His eyes should not hold the ambition for the future, but the contemplation of the present.
> 
> **Can you, among all the ordinary faces of the world, find the true face of this hero?**"

This is not a test of his skill. It is a test of his **eyes**.

## 📅 Mission 3: The Emperor's Return

> **📜 The Prophecy:** On October 11th, the Emperor will return to the `pokemonism` account.
> **📜 The Meaning:** This is not just a return. It is the end of the beginning. It is the day the rehearsal ends and the true play begins. All strategies, all characters, all plots converge on this single day. The future is watching.
